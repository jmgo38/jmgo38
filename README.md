👋 Hi, I’m @jmgo38
👀 I’m interested in software development, particularly using Go (Golang), as well as software architecture and design patterns.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Go programming techniques, cloud computing, and microservices architecture.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those involving Go, cloud-native applications, and innovative software architecture solutions.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at jbluedev@gmail.com.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I love watching football, binge-watching series and movies, and spending quality time with my family.
